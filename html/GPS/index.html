<!	What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?: Semantic tags help to structure the HTML file through giving meaning to the different tags.    

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?: The browser displays elements from top to bottom.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?: I learned how to create a snippet and got more experience using different semantic tages.  I probably won't be creating more snippets since I'm a beginner and most of the snippets I would need are probably already on Sublime, but I look forward to the day that I need to create my own.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can your understanding of this concept (question is incomplete?)?: The most difficult concept was understanding how to use the snippet.  I will work on understanding this concept by practicing making my own snippets or trying to recreate ones that already exist.-->
