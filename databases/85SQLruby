DESCRIPTION:
I've lived in Chicago for 4.5 years and have moved to 6 different apartments.  When I was moving, I relied heavily on different websites to search for a new place.  This is an attempt at a primitive apartment hunter database.  Renters can search for apartments based on specified critera, add apartments that they're interested in, and owners can list place(s) they want to rent.
