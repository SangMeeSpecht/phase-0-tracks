# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

  Version control is a tool that allows a user to see all of the revisions he/she has made, review and undo changes, make backups, and merge revisions together.  Version control is useful because it keeps thorough records of any changes made and allows users to undo any mistakes, which is critical if you're working on a project with many people where many mistakes will be made.  


* What is a branch and why would you use one?

  A branch is just a copy of a project that a user can work on.  A developer would want to use a branch instead of working on the master branch because it allows for many collaborators to work on many different parts of a program and allows users to organize/separate features into different compartments.
  

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

  A commit is a command that allows the user to create a save point on a timeline in a version-control program where he/she can go back to.  A commit message should be a short description about what was added, fixed, or changed in the software.  It is protocol to use imperative present tense.


* What is a merge conflict?

  A merge conflict is an event that happens when a version-control program is unable to merge two branches on its own.  These conflicts need to be resolved before two branches can properly merge.
