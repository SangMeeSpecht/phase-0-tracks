# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

  Version control is a tool that allows a user to see all of the revisions he/she has made, review and undo changes, make backups, and merge revisions together.  Version control is useful because it keeps thorough records of any changes made and allows users to undo any mistakes, which is critical if you're working on a project with many people where many mistakes will be made.  Git is an example of a version control program.  


* What is the difference between Git and GitHub?  

  Git is a tool that is used on a local computer versus GitHub, which is a remote service where developers can use the Git tool to collaborate on projects.  


* What are the reasons for using GitHub?

  GitHub is an extremely useful service because it allows for many different people to work on one project, developers can easily share projects with others, and you can safely store your projects in another place besides your local computer.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

  A branch is just a copy of a project that a user can work on.  A developer would want to use a branch instead of working on the master branch because it allows for many collaborators to work on many different parts of a program and allows users to organize/separate features into different compartments.
  
* What are the three states of a file in Git?

  1. Change file: update file with any changes 
  2. Add/stage file: adding, but not saving, updated file(s) to an area to be 
     committed
  3. Commit file: create a save point in the development timeline with a message 
     describing the update made to the committed file


* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

  A commit is a command that allows the user to create a save point on a timeline in a version-control program where he/she can go back to.  A commit message should be a short description about what was added, fixed, or changed in the software.  It is protocol to use imperative present tense.


* What is a merge conflict?  How do you resolve it?

  A merge conflict is an event that happens when a version-control program is unable to merge two branches on its own.  These conflicts need to be resolved before two branches can properly merge.  How to resolve a merge conflict depends on the cause of the conflict.  When there is a merge conflict, a message will appear on the command line, telling the developer which file the merge conflict is in.  After opening the file, the developer will be shown where there is conflict between the two files.  Next, the changes will be made manually on the filek in order to resolve any conflict.  Any changes then need to be staged and committed in order for the merge conflict to resolve.
