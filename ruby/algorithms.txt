4   5   6
1   2   3

-Move body clockwise until front of body faces elevator side with elevator buttons.
-Move left or right to the side with the buttons.
-Move robot arm up until it is perpendicular to the 8 button:
-Ask, "What floor would you like to go to?"
	-If a voice command is heard: 
		-If number is >9 and <13, move arm up 1 row:
			-If number is equal to 11, extend arm forward and push button, then move arm down until it is parallel with floor
			-If number is equal to 9, move arm left extend arm forward and push button, then move arm down until it is parallel with floor
			-If number is equal to 12, move arm right, extend arm forward and push button, then move arm down until it is parallel with floor
		-Else, if number is >12 and <16, move are up 2 rows:
			-If number is equal to 14, extend arm forward and push button, then move arm down until it is parallel with floor
